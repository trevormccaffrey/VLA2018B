    "To begin the week, I revisited the images I created last week to try to create a set of images showing more noise.  This also allowed me to obtain more rms values of each science target observation closer to our expected value of 7.5uJy.  Although none of the images possessed a value right around 7.5uJy, there are no longer any images with an rms value of ~2uJy -- this was likely a result of overcleaning into the noise of the image, as Amy had mentioned.  These are the updated rms values:\n",
